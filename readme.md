# About Mdmdt theme

[中文文档](./readme.zh.md)

**Mdmdt** is the abbreviation for Markdown Minimalism document theme, meaning: Markdown Minimalist Document Theme, which is a lightly customized personalized Typora theme.

The purpose of the **Mdmdt** theme is to create a minimalist document style, allowing users to more intuitively distinguish different block contents while focusing on the document content itself.

Compared to the default theme style, the following aspects have been mainly modified:
1. A simple and comfortable color scheme style
2. Add rounded corner style
3. Title Style
4. Table Style
5. Reference box style
6. Image Style
7. Code Highlight Style
8. File Tree Style
9. Document list style: changed to card structure
10. Outline style: Added a directory tree structure, making the directory hierarchy more concise and clear
11. Automatically follow the bright/dark theme mode of the system (the bright/dark theme can be set separately)

# How to use it

Using custom themes is very simple, as follows:

1. Open `Preferences` -> `Appearance` -> `Open Theme Folder`
2. Copy the downloaded `mdmdt.cs`  file to the theme folder.
3. **Exit Typora and reopen**，In the `Menu Bar` -> `Themes`, Select **Mdmdt** theme and complete the theme switch.

If you only want to use a separate bright or dark theme, the method is as follows:
1. Open `Preferences` -> `Appearance` -> `Open Theme Folder`
2. Copy `mdmdt-light.css` or `mdmdt-dark.css ` to the theme folder.
3. **Exit Typora and reopen**，In the `Menu Bar` -> `Themes`, Select **Mdmdt Light** or **Mdmdt Dark** theme and complete the theme switch.
